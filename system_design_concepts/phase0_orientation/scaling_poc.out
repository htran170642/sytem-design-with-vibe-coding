🎯 Phase 0: Understanding Scaling
===================================
Let's see what happens when we scale from 1 server to multiple servers...

🖥️  Single Server Demo
==============================
Processing 12 requests sequentially...
  Request 1 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 2 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 3 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 4 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 5 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 6 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 7 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 8 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 9 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 10 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 11 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 12 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s

📊 Results:
  • Total time: 1.20 seconds
  • Requests processed: 12
  • Average time per request: 0.10s
  • Throughput: 10.0 requests/second

🖥️ 🖥️ 🖥️  Multi-Server Demo (3 servers)
========================================
Processing 12 requests in parallel...
  Request 1 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 2 handled by Server-2 in 0.10s
  Request 3 handled by Server-3 in 0.10s
  Request 4 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 5 handled by Server-2 in 0.10s
  Request 6 handled by Server-3 in 0.10s
  Request 7 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 8 handled by Server-2 in 0.10s
  Request 9 handled by Server-3 in 0.10s
  Request 10 handled by Server-1 in 0.10s
  Request 11 handled by Server-2 in 0.10s
  Request 12 handled by Server-3 in 0.10s

📊 Results:
  • Total time: 0.10 seconds
  • Requests processed: 12
  • Load distribution: [4, 4, 4]
  • Throughput: 118.0 requests/second

🚀 Scaling Impact:
  • Time reduction: 91.5%
  • Speed improvement: 11.8x faster
  • This is HORIZONTAL SCALING - adding more servers

💡 Key Insights:
  • Single server: processes requests one by one (sequential)
  • Multiple servers: process requests simultaneously (parallel)
  • More servers = higher throughput (requests/second)
  • But also more complexity (coordination, load balancing)

⬆️  Vertical Scaling Demo
==============================
What if instead of adding servers, we make our server faster?

Testing 5 requests:
  • Slow server (0.2s per request): 1.00s total
  • Fast server (0.1s per request): 0.50s total
  • Improvement: 0.5x faster

💡 This is VERTICAL SCALING:
  • Same number of servers, but more powerful
  • Upgrade CPU, RAM, or storage
  • Simpler than horizontal scaling
  • But has limits - can't scale infinitely

🎓 What We Just Learned:
  • HORIZONTAL SCALING: Add more servers (scale out)
  • VERTICAL SCALING: Make servers more powerful (scale up)
  • Both approaches help handle more load
  • Each has different trade-offs and limitations
